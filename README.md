# Modesty

Modesty is an Android-first, free and open-source audio editor focused on making ordinary audio jobs fast without giving up a real editing core.

The guiding rule is simple:

> Quick tools are views into the same editor engine, not separate watered-down implementations.

## Foundation

The foundation is being built and tested one brick at a time:

- immutable project / track / clip metadata
- source audio stays separate from edit metadata
- edit transactions with undo and redo
- DSP contracts kept independent from UI
- multi-resolution waveform cache
- playback, decode, and encode boundaries
- Android shell kept dependency-light

The project currently targets `compileSdk 36` / `targetSdk 36` and uses JDK 17. This is intentional while the core is being established so CI does not depend on API 37 tooling.

## Current brick

**Brick #2: WAV ingestion and waveform generation**

The Android shell can pick a real WAV document, parse its metadata, decode its samples to floating-point PCM, build a multi-resolution min/max/RMS waveform pyramid off the UI thread, and render the waveform.

Currently supported WAV sample encodings:

- PCM integer: 8, 16, 24, and 32-bit
- IEEE float: 32 and 64-bit
- WAVE_FORMAT_EXTENSIBLE when its sub-format is PCM or IEEE float

Playback and editing are intentionally not connected to the UI yet.

## First useful target

Open audio → waveform → select → trim / split / move / amplify → undo / redo → export.

Quick Trim, Quick Amplify, and Quick Join will eventually sit on top of those exact same operations.

## Build

Open the repository in Android Studio, or use Gradle 9.5.0 with JDK 17:

```bash
gradle testDebugUnitTest assembleDebug
```

A Gradle wrapper will be committed once generated from a normal Gradle installation; until then CI installs the pinned Gradle version explicitly.

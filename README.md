# Modesty

Modesty is an Android-first, free and open-source audio editor focused on making ordinary audio jobs fast without giving up a real editing core.

The guiding rule is simple:

> Quick tools are views into the same editor engine, not separate watered-down implementations.

## Foundation

The first foundation keeps the project deliberately small:

- immutable project / track / clip metadata
- source audio stays separate from edit metadata
- edit transactions with undo and redo
- DSP contracts kept independent from UI
- waveform cache contracts
- playback, decode, and encode boundaries
- Android shell kept dependency-light

The project currently targets `compileSdk 36` / `targetSdk 36` and uses JDK 17. This is intentional while the core is being established so CI does not depend on API 37 tooling.

## First useful target

Open audio → waveform → select → trim / split / move / amplify → undo / redo → export.

Quick Trim, Quick Amplify, and Quick Join will eventually sit on top of those exact same operations.

## Build

Open the repository in Android Studio, or use Gradle 9.5.0 with JDK 17:

```bash
gradle testDebugUnitTest assembleDebug
```

A Gradle wrapper will be committed once generated from a normal Gradle installation; until then CI installs the pinned Gradle version explicitly.
